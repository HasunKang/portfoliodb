She is interested in collaborating with fields like psychology and sociology to create works that benefit marginalized communities. Hasun is particularly fascinated by how abstraction has evolved in contemporary art movements and prefers it because it allows artists to express their perspectives in a lively way. She experiments with various materials to explore geometric abstraction. ",
